# How to Select Data Rows


<p>This example shows how to select data rows by double clicking them. Since the current version (9.2.2) doesn't support row selection, it is implemented using templates. In this sample, when a row is double clicked, an image is displayed within a cell in the 'Product Name' column. This indicates that a row is selected. The 'Unit Price' column displays the total price of selected products, which is manually calculated within the CustomSummary event handler.</p>
